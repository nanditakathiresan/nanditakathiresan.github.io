							<h3>
								Welcome! I'm Nandita Kathiresan, a Computer Science student at Cornell University. My journey has been
								filled with exciting experiences, from interning at Microsoft and contributing to AI and Azure projects
								to founding Shopala, an app that promotes sustainable shopping decisions. At Microsoft, I extended OCR
								tools and analyzed Azure Gaming SKUs, showcasing my full-stack development skills and performance
								analysis expertise.
							</h3>
							<p>
								As a founder of Shopala, I'm leading a team to create an app that helps users determine the
								cost-per-wear of clothing items. It's a passion project that received funding from Cornell's Johnson
								student Startup Accelerator. Beyond that, my diverse background includes coding instruction at CodaKid
								and a research internship where I developed simulations for ozone pattern detection. Alongside my
								technical skills in Python, Java, React, and more, I'm an active member of the Alpha Kappa Psi Business
								Fraternity, where I honed my professional soft skills.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside the tech world, you'll find me enjoying long-distance running, experimenting with cooking, and
								exploring the great outdoors through hiking. I've also been recognized for my achievements, including an
								Honorable Mention in the COVID-19 HealthCare App Challenge with Microsoft. With a blend of technical
								expertise, leadership experience, and a friendly approach, I'm excited about the dynamic opportunities
								ahead in the field of computer science!

							The app can be run on any mobile device and can be placed outside classrooms/halls/buildings. The student
							simply faces the app and the app will detect if the student is wearing the mask correctly. If they are, a
							“PERFECT” popup will occur. If the student is wearing it incorrectly, it will prompt a popup with
							instructions on how to fix it. The app can recognize when a person comes into focus and will automatically
							start analyzing the mask. This takes 2-3 seconds for the app to detect this. Because this is all
							automatic, no touching is needed. This will prevent any possible transmission which sets it apart from
							other apps that require users to click buttons. In addition, the teacher can set an interval for how often
							to analyze to speed up the process. This makes it possible to analyze a whole class effortlessly.

						</p>

						<p>I used JavaScript and React Native to build the app. I also used the Expo IDE Client to test my
							application on my mobile device. The image recognition was aided by the Clarifai image recognition API,
							and I built a custom model to teach the computer to recognize proper mask-wearing etiquette. I had to
							input JSON metadata for many example images that I used such as “MOVE MASK UP TO COVER NOSE COMPLETELY”,
							“PERFECT!”, and “TIGHTEN GAPS ON THE SIDES!” when I was training the model.</p>

						<p>Challenges I ran into Training the model to recognize these nuances was difficult and took hours of
							training before it got above the desired accuracy. But the most difficult challenge was making this all
							touch-free. Initially, I was planning to use Google API Speech Recognition to prompt the app to begin
							analyzing when users spoke to the app. Students should not touch the device (if they did, it would defeat
							the whole purpose of reducing transmission at schools). But this took longer for the app to recognize and
							is not compatible for younger children who are still having trouble speaking clearly / are in a loud
							environment like a busy hallway. So I changed my idea. I instead set interval timers and used the Clarifai
							API to call the function to start analyzing when it saw a child, person, or adult in focus. I found this
							to be much more efficient and compatible for all students and environments.</p>

						<p>In the future, this could be used in places other than schools that require masks (shopping centers,
							workplaces, gyms…). It is a universal application geared to all users. But, for the students, I would like
							to make more animations/sound effects to make the app more engaging and fun for younger students. After
							all, this is a big adjustment for them, so my goal is to keep the community safe while making sure that
							the kids get comfortable with wearing masks, too.</p>

						<p>Also, I would like the app to send texts to the teacher informing him/her if any students entered without
							wearing the mask correctly. This streamlines the monitoring process and gives the teacher a record in case
							any contact tracing is required potentially.</p>

						<a href="assets/download/Shopala Pitch NYC.pdf" download target="_blank">Check Out The
							Pitch!</a>

						<p>
							Our generation is obsessed with online shopping, especially during quarantine. I personally have online
							shopped a lot, and recently, I have researched about the damage this is causing to our planet and the
							health of thousands. The textile industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world , and due
							to fast fashion brands like Zara and Shein , buying cheap, trendy clothing is appealing. However, the
							waste from making these items is damaging waterways, using up hundreds of gallons of oil and water,
							releasing more emissions than flights, and the chemical runoff is leaving people with medical health
							issues . We can’t just tell people to stop shopping. Instead we can teach people how to become smarter
							shoppers and help them save money and help the planet at the same time. So, I have developed Shopala , the
							first machine learning shopping assistant app of its kind.

						</p>

						<p>It calculates cost per wear of items that users want to buy while they are shopping, based on items the
							user already has . When users take a picture of items they want, the machine learning used enables the app
							to compare the image to previously imputed images of clothing that the user already has. It takes the cost
							of the new item and divides it by the number of times users wore a similar item in their closet.</p>

						<p>I used react native to develop the mobile application. I used the React APIs to render the components on
							a mobile device. I also used Clarifai API to incorporate machine learning. I created a custom model to get
							the model to begin understanding differences among specifically clothing and store json metadata of the
							amount of times users wore that particular item. As users input more apps, the model becomes more
							intelligent in recognizing differences in apparel, fabric, and clothing types.</p>

						<p>
							After getting a positive response from the hackathon, I wanted to expand this further and do user testing
							and start a startup. I participated in the Cornell Entrepreneruship Lab Accelerator program and led a team
							of 6 students. We spoke to about 150 potential customers and defined our value proposition. We recieved
							funding from Cornell to make our vision a reality. We published the app to the apple app store and
							continued user testing. Our next goal is to create a web extension to do this cost-per-wear calculation
							and suggestion functionality.

							The light is finally at the end of the tunnel in the U.S. as we are getting closer and closer to new
							normalcy following the pandemic. However, another issue is rising. Covid-19 not only affected people by
							causing the virus to spread and kill over half a million people in the US. Mental health issues rose, and
							are predicted to rise after we approach new normalcy. According to the National Institute of Mental
							Health’s Dimensional Traumatic Stress Research Program, the percentage of people reporting they felt
							anxious or depressed spiked and remained at high levels since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
							Some of the causes include substance misuse, anxiety and uncertainty, job losses, grief, and lack of
							social interaction. I am sure that all of us either experienced some of these ourselves or saw others
							experience some of the things we have mentioned, unfortunately. As we approach a new normal, we must have
							more resources available to people who are suffering from mental health issues following the pandemic. So,
							the project that we have been working on is Medity: a smart, mental health app that serves as a mindful
							reflection journal that provides users with motivational messages, and resources if they need them.

						</p>

						<p>Users can log onto the app and will be directed to their calendar page where they can input their
							reflection for the day. Research done by Giada Dwe Stefano, Francesca Gino, Gary Pisano, and Bradley
							Staats done in call centers demonstrated that employees who spent 15 minutes at the end of the day
							reflecting about lessons learned performed 23% better after 10 days than those who did not reflect. Not
							only does it make people more productive, but studies also show that it helps people stay happier and more
							cognizant of what’s bothering them. Once they input their data, the app will store this information, and
							we have used Natural Language Processing to decipher the sentiment of these reflections.

							Once it understands how positive or negative the message is, the app will do two things. First, based on
							how positive or negative the tweet is, it will send a notification to the user first thing in the morning
							when they wake up (users set the time), and they can wake up to a motivational quote in the morning. We
							have compiled an open-source database of quotes and will have the app pick from these based on how the
							user was feeling the night before.

							For example, we had said that we were feeling anxious the night before because of an interview we had this
							morning. The program understood that it had a negative sentiment (but not seriously negative), so it gave
							me an uplifting quote to look at the positives and told me to go crush it today. But, had we said
							something more negative, the app would send me actionable resources for support. This is to help the user
							locate mental health resources in their nearby area if the app predicts that they need more help than just
							motivation.

							Mental health hotlines will also be attached. Sometimes, it's easier to put this personal information into
							an inanimate object like a phone rather than sitting face to face with a human. Some people are shy or
							find it difficult to be vulnerable, so this can be one of the first ways they can recognize they need
							help. This could be helpful for the mental health telehealth industry that is growing. Of course, getting
							treatment from a professional is always the best option, but understanding that you need help in the first
							place is essential to the process. For people suffering from less urgent issues, the quotes and motivation
							can be encouraging.</p>

						<p>We have used an open-source tweet database that has hundreds of tweets and set sentiments of these tweets
							(positive or negative). Using this, we were able to train the model to understand the reflections that
							users input into the app. We first filtered non-relevant information using Regex from the inputted text
							(emojis, hashtags, multiple letters in a word used to emphasize a point, HTTPS in URLs, word/punctuation
							repetition. Then we used lemmatization (converting the words to their root form). We then got rid of
							stopwords (like “a”, “the” that do not contribute much to deciphering the actual sentiment. After all of
							these methods were complete, we used the methods to filter out the inputted text to what is shown on the
							screen. Now once these words are extracted, we are comparing these words to the tweets and we are figuring
							out how often they show up in the positive or negative tweets. For example, the word “love” shows up more
							frequently in the positive tweets, but the “nervous” word shows up more frequently in the negative
							sentiments. We used resources from AIOutsider to learn more about regex and the purpose of omitting
							certain information. Using this information, we can see if the phrases are leaning towards positive or
							negative sentiments. Finally, once the sentiments are clarified, we are using a LogisticRegression model
							to see whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. We used a logistic regression model to train
							the model, and we needed to evaluate this model repeatedly (80% of the data was used to train). We
							realized that feeding in test data manually would take too long, so we implemented an MLOps pipeline to
							care of this. We were able to use iteration to feed in the tweet data that we did not use to train the
							model with and use this for test purposes instead. We simultaneously uploaded this test data into a
							separate file to review and monitor for accuracy using our logistic regression model. Automation here made
							it more feasible to test possible sentiments quickly.

							We were interested in testing the model we had build against the BERT classifier so we are using our
							sentiment model (sentiment.py) and comparing how well the NLP is working compared to BERT. We were
							interested in the BERT classifier used in the stock sentiment analysis demo created by Iguazio so we
							wanted to take a similar approach for Medity.

							Logistic regression is great for pinpointing whether something is positive or negative, true/false, but
							moving forward, we would probably lean towards another model to understand more about the tweet. Rather
							than just positive or negative, was the user anxious, excited, or worse like depressed. But for the
							hackathon, this model was successful in telling me to what degree the user was feeling positive or
							negative.</p>

						<p>
							After getting a positive response from the hackathon, I wanted to expand this further and do user testing
							and start a startup. I participated in the Cornell Entrepreneruship Lab Accelerator program and led a team
							of 6 students. We spoke to about 150 potential customers and defined our value proposition. We recieved
							funding from Cornell to make our vision a reality. We published the app to the apple app store and
							continued user testing. Our next goal is to create a web extension to do this cost-per-wear calculation
							and suggestion functionality.

							As schools reopen amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, students must social distance to prevent themselves and
							teachers from getting ill . According to The New York Times, new studies reveal that “ children younger
							than age 5 may host up to 100 times as much of the virus in the upper respiratory tract as adults.” This
							goes against the widespread belief that children are safe from the virus, but in reality, they are
							susceptible to transmit and acquire the virus. Schools need to take more precaution. However, it will be
							difficult to monitor each student, especially when the teacher is busy teaching. We know so many people
							who work in the education field, including close relatives, so this is a serious concern to our team. We
							want to help our community stay safe by preventing spread, so we decided to make an application that would
							help teachers avoid COVID-19 spread in classrooms . Source:
							https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/health/coronavirus-children.html

						</p>

						<p>With technology, we can solve this problem by detecting if students are less than 6ft apart and alert the
							teacher, and show the region in the classroom where students are not complying . We also included a way
							for the app to detect if students are wearing their masks correctly and the teacher will be notified if
							students are not . With these analytics, the teacher can successfully alter the classroom environment if
							needed and enforce the rules. This will significantly prevent students from getting and spreading COVID-19
							and prevent teachers (many of whom are more susceptible) from getting COVID-19 and protect our community .
						</p>

						<p>We used python to build the framework of the app. We explored OpenCV , YOLO , and Darknet to build the
							image recognition feature of detecting people and detecting if they are 6ft apart. We also used Linux, we
							used YOLO software, OpenCV, and CUDA to start training and testing our machine for face mask detection.
							While we did get some preliminary code working, we do not have a functioning product for face mask
							detection. Our face mask prototype in the demo simply showcases the UI we want to achieve. We are still
							working on training and testing our machine.</p>

						<p>
							It was our first time using an open source neural network so figuring out how to connect these components
							in such little time was difficult. We had to go through a lot of documentation to learn about this
							technology and then it took hours to implement in our application. It was also difficult to be able to
							figure out the average area among all the “red zones” using OpenCV, but we are pleasantly surprised that
							we got it to work with great accuracy. In terms of mask detection, we had a lot of difficulty using Linux
							to utilize YOLO software, OpenCV, and Darknet. While we did get preliminary code to work, we are still
							working on training and testing our machine.
